How you can run this locally (step-by-step)

If you want to repeat the setup/run on your machine or run it later, follow these steps in a zsh terminal.

1) Activate the venv (optional but recommended)
- If you already have the venv created at .venv, activate it:

source /Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse/.venv/bin/activate

If you don't have a venv and want to create one:

cd /Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

2) Install dependencies (if not already installed)

pip install -r /Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse/requirements.txt

(Or install specific packages:)

pip install streamlit yfinance pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly

3) Run the Streamlit app

streamlit run /Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse/app.py

or explicitly via the venv Python:

/Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse/.venv/bin/python -m streamlit run /Users/devarajanma/stock_pulse/app.py

4) Open the app in your browser
- Visit: http://localhost:8501

Troubleshooting & notes
- If the browser shows an error "No module named ...", make sure the venv is activated and you installed packages into that venv (use `which python` / `which pip` to confirm).
- Streamlit suggests installing watchdog for faster reloading on macOS. You can install it:

pip install watchdog
xcode-select --install   # if prompted for developer tools (macOS)

- If port 8501 is already used, start Streamlit on another port:

streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502

- If your app references local modules (like `technical_indicators.py` and `utils.py`), ensure they are importable (they're in the project root, so they should be fine). If you see import errors, paste them here and I’ll fix them.

- If you want Streamlit to be reachable from other machines on your LAN, use the Network URL shown by Streamlit.
